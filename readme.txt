This is an experiment where participants are to find target objects, 
hidden in a context image (the placeholder image used here doesn't 
demonstrate this very well though). To run the experiment, open 
the find_targets.psyexp file and run.

I've deliberately left the trial durations the way they are in the original experiment so that the strain on the computer from the experiment will be obvious. CHANGE THE TRIAL DURATIONS IF YOU ARE ONLY INTERESTED IN GOING THROUGH THE EXPERIMENT QUICKLY.

The images used in the original task are copyrighted. In the original task, there are
six different context images, with one target object each. So, each trial of the
experiment has a context+target of its own.

The image used as a placeholder for the actual task images is licensed with
Creative Commons Zero and was downloaded from Max Pixel,

The experiment uses the find_targets.csv file in order to find the images -
if you change the contents of the .csv file, the experiment won't work.
